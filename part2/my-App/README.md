### The choosen Design Principle

is Dependency Injection (DI), The mean reasons for choosing this pattren is:

- easly can reuse services without any need to make any changes in the constructor of an other function -> Extandable
- A class is independent from the creation of the objects it depends on
- The objects it uses support different configurations

### what should we implement

1. services: which we have the service (functions)
2. Interfaces: Clients should not know how their dependencies are implemented, only their names and how to use
3.
